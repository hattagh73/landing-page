## 📢 Landing Page via Tailwind
In this project we will explore on the introduction of basic to `Tailwind CSS Framework` by creating a one section of **landing page**. Added `overlay` whereby when user is `hovering` to the `section` thus it will become a little bit `darker`. To ease user to read clearly since the background image is quite bright.
